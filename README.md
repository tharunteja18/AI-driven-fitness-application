This project is a **microservices-based fitness tracking system** built using **Spring Boot**, with services communicating over **RabbitMQ** and **REST**.

## üì¶ Modules

### 1. `user-service`
- Manages user information and validation.

### 2. `activity-service`
- Accepts and processes activity data (running, walking, etc.)
- Sends messages to `activity.queue` via RabbitMQ
- Uses `WebClient` to communicate with `user-service`

### 3. `ai-service`
- Listens to `activity.queue` from RabbitMq
- Sends back personalized recommendations after inteacting with GEMINI API using the WebClient.

### 4. `gateway-service`
- Which act like front door to all the services.
- Instead of exposing each service directly, we expose gateway. which act as a single entry point for extenral client calls.

### - Every service (user, activity, ai, gateway) is registered with Eureka for service discovery.
